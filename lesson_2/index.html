							documents</a> dating back to
						the Obama administration keep
						turning up in President Joe
						Biden’s personal workspaces,
						beginning with 10 documents
						found in November, days before
						the
						election, to six additional
						documents discovered at the
						President’s home in Delaware
						this week.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Justice Department has
						opened an investigation into
						whether the classified
						documents—which are
						supposed to remain in secure
						locations tracked by the
						National Archives—were ever
						mishandled, and
						if any federal laws were
						violated. Details about how many
						total classified documents were
						discovered and their contents
						remain unclear.President Donald
						Trump
					</p>
					<p>The situation is eerily
						reminiscent of former President
						<a href="https://time.com/6243423/donald-trump-disastrous-campaign-launch/" target="_blank">Donald
							Trump</a>’s possession of
						classified
						documents first discovered at
						his Florida home in June. Biden
						condemned Trump’s actions and
						supported the special counsel
						investigation into the former
						president’s handling of the
						documents,
						which began just two weeks
						before the first batch of
						Biden’s classified documents
						were discovered.
					</p>
					<p>The timing of the discoveries
						also raises questions about why
						the investigations—which began
						one
						day after the midterm elections
						that the Democratic party was
						favored to lose—were kept quiet
						for
						so long. It wasn’t until last
						week when news investigations
						revealed the discoveries that
						the White
						House publicly acknowledged the
						case. </p>
					<p>“<mark>People know I take
							classified documents and
							classified materials
							seriously,” Biden said at a
							briefing on Thursday, adding
							that he was “cooperating
							fully and completely with the
							Justice
							Department’s review.</mark>”
					</p>
					<p>Here’s the timeline of events:
					</p>
					<h4>November 2022</h4>
					<p>On November 2, Biden’s private
						attorneys unexpectedly
						discovered the first collection
						of about 10
						classified documents from the
						Obama-Biden administration in a
						locked closet at the Penn Biden
						Center office in Washington
						D.C—a think tank that Biden
						founded. Biden began working at
						the office
						occasionally in 2017 after his
						vice presidency ended. </p>
					<p>Following statutory
						requirements, the documents were
						voluntarily turned over to the
						National
						Archives and Records
						Administration (NARA). On
						November 4, NARA informed the
						Justice Department
						(DOJ) about the revelation.
						Midterm elections, where the
						Democratic party was favored to
						lose its
						Congressional majority, took
						place a few days later on
						November 8. </p>
					<p>On November 9, the FBI began an
						inquiry into whether any laws
						were broken and if classified
						information was mishandled.
						Several days later on November
						14, U.S. Attorney General
						Merrick
						Garland assigned John Lausch,
						U.S. attorney for the Northern
						District of Illinois, to the
						case to
						determine if a special counsel
						was needed.</p>
					<h4>December 2022</h4>
					<p>The following month, Biden’s
						personal counsel found
						additional classified documents
						in the
						president’s private library
						attached to his garage during an
						inspection of his home in
						Wilmington,
						Delaware on December 20. The
						attorneys informed Lausch about
						the findings and handed the
						documents
						over the following day.</p>
					<h4>January 2023</h4>
					<p>A few days into the new year,
						Lausch filled Garland in on the
						investigation on January 5 and
						recommended that the DOJ appoint
						<a href="https://time.com/4774442/robert-mueller-special-counsel-independent-prosecutor-donald-trump-russia/" target="_blank">a special
							counsel</a>, who would
						extensively
						investigate and
						potentially prosecute any
						wrongdoing.
					</p>
					<p>On January 9, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-center-classified-documents/" target="_blank">CBS News</a>
						was the first to report on
						November’s
						discovery of classified
						documents,
						bringing the case to public
						attention. The White House then
						publicly confirmed the inquiry,
						saying
						that the administration was
						cooperating with the DOJ and
						NARA, but didn’t mention the
						additional
						classified documents found in
						December.</p>
					<p>“The White House is cooperating
						with the National Archives and
						the Department of Justice
						regarding
						the discovery of what appear to
						be Obama-Biden Administration
						records, including a small
						number of
						documents with classified
						markings,” White House lawyer
						Richard Sauber said in a
						statement.</p>
					<p>On January 10 at a <a href="https://time.com/6247483/biden-classified-documents-timeline/" target="_blank">news
							conference from Mexico</a>,
						Biden said that he
						was surprised to learn about the
						classified documents, explaining
						that his team helped him set up
						his personal office after his
						vice
						presidency ended. The White
						House asserted that it was an
						oversight and that Biden’s team
						acted
						immediately to hand over all
						classified documents upon their
						discovery. </p>
					<p>During another inspection of
						Biden’s home on January 11, his
						personal counsel found <a href="https://time.com/6246994/biden-classified-documents-delaware-corvette/" target="_blank">
							one more
							classified document
						</a> stored in a room adjacent
						to the garage. The lawyers
						informed the DOJ about the
						latest uncovering the next day,
						on January 12. These documents
						were in addition to the ones
						found
						there in December.</p>
					<p>That afternoon, Garland
						announced the appointment of
						Robert Hur, a Trump-era U.S.
						attorney for the
						district of Maryland, as <a href="https://time.com/6247018/biden-classified-documents-special-counsel/" target="_blank">special
							counsel</a>. “The
						extraordinary
						circumstances here require the
						appointment of a special counsel
						for this matter,” Garland said
						at the briefing, also mentioning
						the second batch of classified
						documents obtained in December.
					</p>
					<p>Later that day, Biden’s team
						found an additional five
						classified documents at his home
						in
						Wilmington. The White House
						shared this discovery on January
						14.</p>
					<p>“<mark>The President directed
							his personal attorneys to be
							forthcoming and fully
							cooperative,</mark>” Bob
						Bauer,
						the president’s personal
						attorney, said in a statement to
						the press on Saturday. “The
						President’s
						personal attorneys have
						attempted to balance the
						importance of public
						transparency where
						appropriate with the established
						norms and limitations necessary
						to protect the investigation’s
						integrity.”</p>

							Harry launched a broadside at
							the king, the
							queen
							consort, his brother and
							other royals in a furious ITV
							interview in which he
							defended his
							revelatory
							memoir, claiming that
							remaining silent “<mark>only
								allows the abuser to
								abuse</mark>”.</span>
					</p>
					<p>In excerpts from his book,
						Spare, read aloud during an
						interview with ITV’s Tom Bradby
						on Sunday
						night,
						Harry wrote that his interests
						had been
						“<mark>sacrificed</mark>” to
						Camilla’s “<mark>PR
							altar</mark>”.</p>
					<p>Asked if he was “<mark>pretty
							consistently scathing</mark>”
						about his stepmother and the
						press, Harry
						replied:
						“<mark>Scathing? There’s no part
							of any of the things that
							I’ve said are scathing
							towards any member
							of my
							family, especially not my
							stepmother. There are things
							that have happened that have
							been
							incredibly
							hurtful, some in the
							past, some current.</mark>”
					</p>
					<p>He accused the royal family of
						“<mark>a really horrible
							reaction</mark>” on the day
						of the Queen’s
						death, saying the family was on
						the “<mark>back foot</mark>” and
						he had witnessed “<mark>leaking
							and
							planting</mark>”. His
						words came after
						it
						was reported he claimed in his
						memoir that Meghan was
						“<mark>not welcome</mark>” at
						Balmoral.</p>
					<p>In the first of several
						interviews to be broadcast
						before the book’s publication
						day, Harry was
						asked
						if his interests had been
						sacrificed for those of his
						father, when it came to the
						press.</p>
					<p>Explaining the royals’
						relationship with the press,
						Harry said:
						“<mark>I love my father, I love
							my brother, I love my
							family.</mark>”
						He had no intention of hurting
						or them, he said. But regarding
						the
						tabloid
						press, he said “<mark>certain
							members have decided to get
							in bed with the devil</mark>”
						to
						rehabilitate their
						own
						images.</p>
					<p>That was their choice, he said,
						adding: “<mark>But the moment
							that rehabilitation comes at
							the
							detriment to others, me,
							other members of my family,
							that’s where I draw the
							line.</mark>”
					</p>
					<p>He spoke of royals competing for
						the limelight. William and Kate,
						he said, had suffered from this
						“<mark>from my father and
							stepmother, or their
							office</mark>”. He thought,
						as the “<mark>spare</mark>”
						to the heir,
						everything
						would be fine with him and
						Meghan.
					</p>
					<p>“<mark>How wrong I was. The very
							thing that William and Kate
							had experienced from Pa and
							Camilla
							happened
							to
							us, and happened from William
							and Kate’s office as
							well,</mark>” he said.</p>
					<p>An excerpt from his audiobook
						was played in which Harry said
						he and William
						told Charles: “<mark>We endorse
							Camilla. Just please don’t
							marry her, just be together,
							Pa.</mark>”</p>
					<p>Harry continues: “<mark>He
							didn’t answer. But she
							answered. Straight away.
							Shortly after our private
							summits
							with her, she began to play
							the long game. A campaign
							aimed at marriage, and
							eventually the
							crown,
							with Pa’s blessing we
							presumed.</mark>”
					</p>
					<p>“<mark>Stories began to appear
							everywhere in all the papers
							about her private
							conversations with
							Willy.
							Stories that contained
							pin-point accurate details,
							none of which had come from
							Willy, of course.
							They
							could only have been leaked
							by the one other person
							present.</mark>”</p>
					<p>Excerpts also revealed that, as
						the relationship between Harry
						and William deteriorated, they
						met
						Charles to discuss the situation
						after the Duke of Edinburgh’s
						funeral. During their exchange,
						William
						swore “<mark>on Mummy’s
							life</mark>” that he just
						wanted Harry to be happy.</p>
					<p>“<mark>For nearly 25 years we’d
							reserved that soul-crushing
							vow for times when one of us
							needed to be
							heard
							to be believed
							quickly,</mark>”
						“<mark>
							It stopped me cold, as it was
							meant to.
							Not because he’d used it. But
							because it didn’t work. I
							simply didn’t believe
							him.</mark>”
						Not because he’d used it. But
						because it didn’t work. I simply
						didn’t believe him.”
					</p>
					<p>Harry said he wanted
						reconciliation, but with
						“<mark>accountability.</mark>”
					</p>
					<p>Asked to justify writing the
						book, and disclosing private
						conversations with his family,
						Harry
						said:
						“<mark>The level of planting and
							leakings from other members
							of the family means that, in
							my mind,
							they
							have
							written countless books,
							certainly millions of words
							have been dedicated to trying
							to trash my
							wife
							and myself to the point where
							I had to leave my
							country.</mark>”
					</p>
					<p>Harry denied he and Meghan had
						accused members of the royal
						family of racism in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/08/meghan-and-harry-oprah-interview-claims-royal-family-concerns-archie-skin-colour-mental-health" target="_blank">
							their Oprah Winfrey
							interview</a>, saying:
						“<mark>The British press said
							that.</mark>” Referring to
						the
						well-reported
						<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/08/meghan-claims-archie-highlight-colourism-problem-uk" target="_blank">
							remarks
							over the
							colour of their son Archie’s
							skin</a>, he described it as
						unconscious bias, not racism. He
						also
						said the
						<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/30/buckingham-palace-aide-resigns-black-guest-traumatised-by-repeated-questioning" target="_blank">incident
							involving charity founder
							Ngozi Fulani and Lady Susan
							Hussey</a> <span>was </span>
						“<mark>a very
							good
							example of the
							environment within the
							institution.</mark>”
					</p>
					<p>Asked if William and Kate had
						not got on with Meghan
						“<mark>almost from the
							get-go</mark>”, Harry
						replied: “<mark>Yeah,
							fair.</mark>” Stereotyping
						had caused a “<mark>bit of a
							barrier</mark>”, he
						said, adding: “<mark>American
							actress, divorced,
							biracial.</mark>”
					</p>
					<p>Harry also spoke about
						“<mark>beardgate</mark>”: a
						bizarre week-long row in which
						Harry revealed he
						had to ask the
						Queen if he could keep his beard
						for his wedding – a no-no
						according to military rules,
						apparently.
						The Queen agreed, after Harry
						explained his beard was “<mark>a
							shield to my anxiety.</mark>”
					</p>
					<p>But he claimed William later
						tried to order him to shave it
						off. It was an “<mark>heir/spare
							thing</mark>”, Harry
						said and also, he thought,
						because William had himself been
						asked to shave off a beard while
						in
						uniform.</p>
					<p>Harry <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/07/prince-harry-i-felt-guilt-meeting-mourners-after-dianas-death" target="_blank">admitted
							to feeling “<mark>some
								guilt</mark>”</a> when
						walking among the crowds
						outside Kensington
						Palace after
						his mother’s death, and feeling
						the mourners’ tears on his hands
						when he shook them, saying the
						only
						time he cried was at her burial.
					</p>
					<p>Harry also revealed how his
						father blamed himself for his
						son’s struggles. Narrating an
						extract
						from
						the book, he read: “Over dinner
						one night at Highgrove, Pa and I
						spoke at some length about what
						I’d
						been suffering.</p>
					<p>“<mark>I gave him the
							particulars, told him story
							after story. Towards the end
							of the meal he looked
							down at his plate and said
							softly: ‘I suppose it’s my
							fault. I should have got you
							the help you
							years ago.</mark>’
					</p>
					<p>“<mark>I assured him that it
							wasn’t his fault, but I
							appreciated the
							apology.</mark>”</p>
					<p>The theme of apologising cropped
						up again when the main US
						interview with Harry to mark
						publication
						of
						his book was broadcast by CBS’
						60 Minutes on Sunday night.
						Asked by journalist Anderson
						Cooper
						whether
						the rupture within the royal
						family could be healed, Harry
						replied: “<mark>Yes. The ball is
							very much
							in
							their court, but you know,
							Meghan and I have continued
							to say that we will openly
							apologise for
							anything that we did wrong …
							There needs to be a
							constructive conversation,
							one that can happen
							in
							private that doesn’t get
							leaked.</mark>”</p>
					<p>Cooper asked him directly
						whether he was in communication
						with William. “<mark>Currently,
							no,</mark>”
						he said.</p>
					<p>Asked whether he spoke to his
						father, Harry replied: “<mark>We
							aren’t, we haven’t spoken for
							quite
							a
							while. No, not
							recently.</mark>”
					</p>
					<p>In addition to the 60 Minutes
						interview, there will be further
						US media appearances with
						Michael
						Strahan of Good Morning America
						on Monday and Stephen Colbert on
						the Late Show on CBS on
						Wednesday
						morning UK time.</p>
					<p>Kensington Palace declined to
						comment on the ITV interview.

						<p>The year is off to a great
							start for comet hunters, as
							what could be the best comet
							of 2023 is now
							set to take center stage in
							January and February. Comet
							C/2022 E3 (ZTF) will make its
							closest
							approach to the Sun on
							Thursday, Jan. 12. Then,
							after zipping around the Sun,
							it will make its
							closest approach to Earth on
							Wednesday, Feb. 1.</p>
						<p>Here’s everything you need to
							know to view Comet C/2022 E3
							(ZTF) as it treks through the
							sky.</p>
						<h3>Where did Comet C/2022 E3
							(ZTF) come from?</h3>
						<p>Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) was
							first discovered in March
							2022 by the Zwicky Transient
							Facility (ZTF),
							which
							scans the entire Northern
							Hemisphere sky once every two
							days from Palomar Observatory
							in
							California.
							You may have noticed many
							other comets have the acronym
							ZTF in their names, too.
							That's because
							they
							were discovered by the same
							facility
						</p>
						<p>C/2022 E3 began its long
							journey in the far outer
							reaches of the solar system,
							within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud" target="_blank">Oort
								Cloud</a>.
							The comet will make its
							closest approach to the Sun,
							or reach perihelion, on Jan.
							12, when it comes
							within 1.1 astronomical unit
							of our star. (One
							astronomical unit, or AU, is
							the average Earth-Sun
							distance.)
						</p>
						<p>Although being closer to the
							Sun can make some comets
							intrinsically brighter, at
							perihelion, C/2022
							E3 will still sit 0.71 AU
							from Earth, meaning it likely
							won't reach naked-eye
							visibility at this
							time.
						</p>
						<p>After rounding the Sun,
							C/2022 E3 will continue to
							grow brighter through the end
							of the month. The
							comet's brightness is
							predicted to peak around Feb
							1, when it makes its closest
							approach to Earth
							by
							passing within about 0.28 AU
							of our planet. At this point,
							many observers and
							astrophotographers
							hope
							C/2022 E3 will reach
							naked-eye magnitudes as it
							skims through a particularly
							rich region of the sky
							near the northern pole,
							setting the scene for some
							gorgeous photos.</p>
						<p>Even at its brightest,
							however, Comet C/2022 E3
							(ZTF) is not expected to form
							a bright, long tail
							that's visible without a
							telescope. Still, even
							without a tail, the comet
							will be a memorable
							sight.
							Plus, comets can always
							surprise us with unexpected
							outbursts, so it’s worth
							following C/2022 E3's
							progress to see what it will
							do!
						</p>
						<h3>How to see comet C/2022 E3
							(ZTF)</h3>

							<p>Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF)
								reaches perihelion on Jan.
								12. Around 4 A.M., you can
								find it high in the
								northeast, floating in the
								constellation Corona
								Borealis.</p>
						</div>

					</div>
					<div>
						<p>Currently visible to
							observers in the Northern
							Hemisphere, the best time to
							view C/2022 E3 is in
							the early morning just a few
							hours before dawn. The
							comet's brightness now stands
							at about
							magnitude 7, making it easily
							visible through binoculars or
							any small telescope. And if
							the comet
							brightens to magnitude 6 or
							better, C/2022 E3 will be
							visible to the naked eye
							under good
							conditions.</p>
						<p>As the comet approaches the
							Sun this week, a waning
							gibbous Moon dominates the
							early-morning sky,
							cutting down on visibility.
							Nonetheless, it’s worth
							trying your luck tracking it
							down with
							binoculars or a telescope.
						</p>
						<p>Try zooming in on the
							green-hued fuzzball as it
							springs from its current
							residence in Corona
							Borealis
							up
							through Bootes and Draco,
							passing through Ursa Minor
							near the cup of the Little
							Dipper at the end
							of
							the
							month. As C/2022 E3 swings
							through the inner solar
							system and passes Earth, it
							will appear to cover
							large
							swaths of the sky each day,
							tracking close to the North
							Star, Polaris. By the time
							C/2022 E3 passes
							near
							Earth in February, the comet
							will lie in Camelopardalis.
						</p>
						<p>This week, C/2022 E3 rises in
							the northeast around
							midnight, climbing higher in
							the sky as dawn
							approaches. That makes it
							best for early-morning
							observers. However, if you’re
							willing to stay up
							late next week, starting on
							Jan 16, you can try spotting
							the comet before the Moon
							rises around 2
							A.M. local time. (Note that
							C/2022 E3 won’t be very high
							in the sky at this point, so
							you’ll want
							to get yourself to high
							ground and opt for a viewing
							location with a clear view of
							the northeastern
							horizon.
						</p>
						<p>By Jan. 18, without the Moon
							to interfere, C/2022 E3 will
							rule the early-morning sky.
							It will then
							be traveling through
							northeastern Bootes headed
							for Draco. Along the way, on
							Jan. 23, the comet
							will pass northeast of the
							galaxies M102 and NGC 5907.
							One day later, any broad tail
							the comet
							might sport will quickly
							narrow (within about a day)
							as the orbital planes of the
							comet and Earth
							cross. Just as quickly,
							however, the tail will appear
							to spread back out after the
							crossing.
						</p>
						<p>On the last day of January,
							C/2022 E3 is just 11.5C from
							Polaris and moving at a
							speedy clip. The
							comet will cover about 12"
							per minute, forcing
							astroimagers to opt for
							shorter exposures if they
							seek to capture any sharp
							details.

						<p>Shortly after C/2022 E3 makes

							visible in
							the Southern Hemisphere. The

							Is Testing A New Way To Crash

						<p>SHIELD, seen here in this

							approach to the costly
							entry, descent, and landing
							strategies currently use by
							NASA to get spacecraft safely
							to the
							surface of Mars. (Credit:

					</div>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>NASA has always taken great care
						when it comes to touching down
						on Mars, relying on parachutes,
						airbags, and even jetpacks to
						ensure their spacecraft safely
						reach the surface. This method
						has worked
						for them nine times in the past.
						But now, an experimental lander
						is looking to try a more
						hard-hitting
						approach.
					</p>
					<p>
						Instead of slowing the craft’s
						descent, SHIELD — which stands
						for Simplified High Impact
						Energy
						Landing Device — would act like
						the crumple zone of a car,
						absorbing much of the energy of
						a hard
						impact.
						This method would work thanks to
						SHIELD's accordion-like,
						collapsible base.

					<div>
						<h3>If it Works For Earth…Why
							Not Mars?</h3>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>The concept for SHIELD
							originated during planning
							for NASA’s Mars Sample Return
							campaign. Since the
							<a href="https://astronomy.com/news/2021/02/watch-stunning-real-video-of-perseverance-landing-on-mars" target="_blank">Perseverance
								rover landed on Mars in
								February 2021</a>, it has
							been busy
							collecting rock samples in
							metal tubes, storing them in
							its belly for now.
						</p>
						<p>Once the team decides exactly
							where and when the samples
							will be picked up for return
							to Earth,
							Perseverance will deposit its
							stomach contents at
							designated sample cache
							depots. From there, a
							Sample Retrieval Lander would
							pick them up, and the Mars
							Ascent Vehicle — the first
							rocket ever to
							launch of the surface of Mars
							— would transport them to
							orbit around Mars. Finally,
							the Earth
							Return Orbiter would snag the
							sample container from Mars
							orbit and venture back home,
							where NASA
							plans to safely crash land
							the sample container in a
							deserted location.</p>
						<p>Preparing for the final step
							in this process made
							engineers wonder: If such a
							hard landing could
							work on Earth, could it work
							on Mars as well?</p>
						<p>To test the idea, the team
							placed a smart phone, radio,
							and accelerometer in their
							prototype SHIELD
							and hoisted it some 90 feet
							(27 meters) to the top of a
							drop tower at the Jet
							Propulsion
							Laboratory. Using a bow
							launch system — essentially a
							giant sling — they then
							hurled the prototype
							and its contents at a steel
							plate at roughly 110 mph (177
							km/h). That’s around the
							speed at which a
							lander would slam into the
							martian surface after being
							slowed by Mars' tenuous
							atmosphere.</p>
						<p>Following the mock crash
							landing, all the electronic
							devices inside SHIELD were
							left largely
							unscathed, with only some
							superfluous plastic
							components damaged. And while
							SHIELD did flip after
							its initial impact, the team
							suspects this was due to the
							metal sheet it struck rather
							than the
							lander's design.</p>
						<p>It was a promising first
							step, leaving the engineers
							pondering what else might be
							possible. “We
							think we could go to more
							treacherous areas, where we
							wouldn’t want to risk trying
							to place a
							billion-dollar rover with our
							current landing systems,”
							said Lou Giersch, SHIELD’s
							project manager,
							in a <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/why-nasa-is-trying-to-crash-land-on-mars" target="_blank">JPL press
								release</a>.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div>
					<div>
						<h3>The Ground’s the Limit</h3>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>Currently, NASA has a limited
							number of safe martian
							landing zones identified and
							available for
							use. After all, they don’t
							want to build a
							billion-dollar rover and send
							it to Mars, only for it to
							fail its landing due to
							avoidable treacherous
							terrain.</p>
						<p>But without the need for the
							harrowing (and costly) entry,
							descent, and landing process
							currently
							used, SHIELD would open new
							areas of Mars to explore. Not
							to mention, “if we can do a
							hard landing
							on Mars,” said Velibor
							Ćormarković, SHIELD team
							member, “we know SHIELD could
							work on planets or
							moons with denser
							atmospheres.”</p>

					<p>But sitting in her Beverly Hills
						kitchen one blistering afternoon
						in June, Adele can easily
						identify
						her own professional nadir: It
						was the morning of January 20,
						when she uploaded a teary video
						to
						Instagram to inform her fans she
						was canceling her Las Vegas
						residency at the Colosseum at
						Caesars
						Palace, which was set to
						premiere the following evening.
						“It was the worst moment in my
						career, by
						far,” she says, within 10
						minutes of us sitting down. She
						hasn’t spoken publicly about the
						debacle in
						the five months since, even as
						rumors about production issues
						and set disagreements swirled,
						and she’s
						eager to address it right away.
						“By far. I was so excited about
						those shows. It was
						devastating.” </p>
					<p>Before Adele posted the video,
						she’d been up for more than 30
						hours straight, tormenting
						herself over
						a choice she’d known for a week
						was the right one to make. But
						her team, already ravaged by
						absences
						from the Omicron surge, felt
						they’d accomplished more under
						tighter deadlines before. And
						there was so
						much on the line: months of
						planning and rehearsals, her
						crew’s and band’s livelihoods,
						and untold
						dollars in investment. Not to
						mention that many thousands of
						ticket holders had planned
						travel around
						birthdays, anniversaries, and
						graduations to come to Vegas and
						see her. Adele was terrified of
						letting
						everyone down. But she also knew
						in her bones that something
						about the show did not feel
						authentic to
						her. “There was just no soul in
						it,” she says. “The stage setup
						wasn’t right. It was very
						disconnected
						from me and my band, and it
						lacked intimacy. And maybe I
						tried too hard to give it those
						things in
						such a controlled environment.”

					<p>At a dress rehearsal the night
						before she announced the
						cancellation, she got frustrated
						enough that,
						during the first song, she
						walked to the end of the
						15,700-square-foot stage, sat
						down, and crossed
						her legs over the side. Then she
						pulled her mic away and started
						singing a cappella to the mostly
						empty, 4,300-plus-seat
						Colosseum. Even unplugged, she
						says, “they could hear me up at
						the top.” As she
						sang, Adele looked out into the
						first few rows and realized it
						was exactly this feeling she’d
						been
						missing: an intimate and
						unpretentious moment with a
						stardom that has, over 15 years
						and more than 120
						million albums sold worldwide,
						become its own life force.</p>
					<p>“This would be the best part of
						the show,” she remembers
						thinking. “For me, and for you.
						This is what
						I want,” she continues,
						motioning to an imagined small
						audience in front of her kitchen
						table, the
						proximity of a fan’s beating
						heart. “And none of that—” she
						gestures behind her, to the idea
						of a
						Vegas stage with its trappings
						and special effects—“has that.”
						The next morning, she called off
						the
						shows.</p>
					<p>It was “brutal,” she says, but
						it was also a choice in line
						with what she is known for: a
						generational
						talent who has earned the right
						to engage with her fame on her
						own terms, and share her art and
						self
						with the world only when she
						feels most ready to do it. “With
						her, everything’s about
						authenticity,”
						says Jonathan Dickins, who has
						been her manager since she was
						18 years old. “For her to go out
						and
						perform a show she’s not happy
						with would be a lie to the
						fans.”</p>

					</p>
					<p>The next day, she would fly to
						New York with her boyfriend of a
						year, the sports agent Rich
						Paul,
						where they had plans to attend
						the wedding of Cleveland
						Cavaliers forward-center Kevin
						Love. Then
						she’d return home to London to
						take her nine-year-old son,
						Angelo, to see Billie Eilish at
						The O2.
						Angelo, whose father is her
						ex-husband, Simon Konecki, is
						“obsessed” with Eilish, Adele
						says. “He’ll
						go up to [his room] after school
						and read all the lyrics and then
						he’ll want to discuss them.” At
						the
						start of July, she would make
						her triumphant return to the
						stage, with two headlining
						nights at BST
						Hyde Park, an annual summer
						festival in London. The rest of
						the headliners were all men, and
						in
						response, Adele assembled an
						all-women bill for her shows,
						including Kacey Musgraves and a
						childhood
						favorite, the R&amp;B singer
						Gabrielle. “London crowds are
						the best,” Adele says, grinning
						in
						anticipation. “They’re gonna be
						drunk before I even go on. We’re
						all gonna have the time of our
						lives.”

					<p>At some point after that, she
						planned to re-announce her
						much-anticipated shows in Vegas.
						Weekends
						With Adele will run at the
						Colosseum beginning toward the
						end of 2022, with nightly shows
						on Friday
						and Saturday each week. The
						announcement will mark an
						overdue culmination for 30.
						Aside from two
						pretaped television specials
						(one in the U.S. and one in the
						UK) that aired the month of 30’s
						release, until her Hyde Park
						shows, Adele had scarcely
						performed any of the songs.
						After the Vegas
						news was out, she largely
						retreated from the public eye.
					</p>
					<p>Outside of her songwriting,
						which—with searing hits like
						“When We Were Young,” “Someone
						Like You,”
						and “Hello”—is vulnerable to the
						point of narrative purgation,
						Adele has always been known as a
						private person. She does not
						have the password to her
						official Instagram account,
						which has more
						than 50 million followers, and
						rarely updates it. Like her
						mononymous peer Beyoncé, she is
						methodical about the press she
						chooses to participate in. When
						she returned to L.A. from Vegas
						in
						January, someone had tipped off
						the paparazzi about her flight,
						so there were cameras waiting at
						Paul’s house when she arrived.
						“I couldn’t even sit in the
						garden and be on the phone with
						my
						friends,” she says. “I was just
						trapped inside.” For a while,
						she had used a secret Twitter
						account
						to occasionally lurk her
						mentions, but as frustrated fans
						began to flood her social media
						accounts
						with critical comments about the
						abrupt announcement, she deleted
						it. “I was embarrassed,” Adele
						says, grimacing at the memory.
						“I went into hiding.”</p>
					<p>As she licked her wounds, she
						more or less stopped promoting
						the album, afraid that doing so
						would
						make it seem like she didn’t
						care about the canceled shows.
						(As a result, she has at least
						one
						unreleased music video for 30 in
						the queue.) “I didn’t want
						anyone to think I weren’t trying
						my
						best,” she says, her voice
						getting quiet. “And I was.”</p>
				</div>

					<img src="img/letter_quotes.jpg" width="53" height="51" alt="Letter qoutes">
					<p>“I was embarrassed [to cancel
						the shows]. But it actually made

					</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>She ventured out for a
						performance of 30’s standout
						power ballad “I Drink Wine” at
						the BRIT Awards in
						London. She wore a custom
						Valentino chiffon dress
						embroidered with lime sequins
						and sat on top of a
						piano, and to her surprise, no
						one booed. “I nearly cried at
						the end of my performance,” she
						remembers. “It felt strange
						receiving so much love when I’d
						let people down.”</p>
					<p>The Colosseum stage is
						massive—its proscenium alone is
						reportedly 120 feet wide, almost
						half the
						length of a football field—and
						it initially posed issues for
						Adele, whose set designs tend to
						be
						understated and elegant. A
						planned water feature element,
						for example, “looked great for a
						couple of
						songs, and then didn’t do
						anything. It was just there.”
					</p>
					<p>In an email, the legendary Bette
						Midler, who had her own
						residency at Caesars from 2008
						to 2010,
						called the sheer size of the
						stage “absolutely terrifying.”
						She was supposed to make her
						grand
						entrance on a custom pile of
						Louis Vuitton luggage, but when
						it arrived during rehearsals, it
						felt
						“like Spinal Tap,” Midler wrote:
						“Just minuscule on that gigantic
						stage. We had to fix the
						luggage,
						which took weeks. So for the
						first few weeks I made my
						entrance riding a donkey.”</p>

					<p>For the stage design at the
						BRITs, Adele teamed up with the
						British entertainment
						architecture firm
						Stufish. It felt like a risky
						leap: “I wasn’t sure if
						[Stufish] were gonna take me
						seriously,
						especially after a failed show.”
					</p>
					<p>She brought them inspiration
						from an unlikely source:
						Angelo’s fifth birthday party,
						for which she’d
						decorated the house herself. “I
						just went down to Michaels,”
						Adele explains, and then pauses
						to cross
						her eyes in pleasure at the mere
						thought of the arts and crafts
						chain. (“I love it there,” she
						says.
						“Oh my God, and World Market.
						You can fuckin’ get some great
						things there.”) She’d bought a
						bunch of
						big sequins and nailed them to a
						board to make her own photo
						booth backdrop, and for the
						BRITs, she
						wanted to re-create something
						like it—only on a national
						broadcast scale. Stufish was
						game, and
						produced a stunning, shimmering
						wall of gold glitter to
						complement her dress. She liked
						working with
						the firm, and they agreed to
						come on board for the revamped
						Vegas shows, along with director
						Matt
						Askem and creative director Kim
						Gavin.</p>
					<p>After the BRITs that night,
						Adele and a couple of close
						friends picked up McDonald’s
						(her order is a
						Big Mac and fries and—“if I’m
						really, really going for it”—six
						McNuggets) and went back to her
						apartment to watch Netflix. As
						her friends dozed off, Adele’s
						eyes drifted to the mantelpiece.
						“My
						TV’s above my fireplace there,”
						she explains, looking over my
						shoulder at the fireplace in her
						L.A.
						kitchen for a comparison. “Let
						me find a pen. My fireplace here
						isn’t the same.”</p>

					<p>She gets up slowly—she has had a
						bad back since she was a
						teenager, and slipped her L6 in
						January
						2021, when Angelo jumped out to
						scare her as she came out of the
						bathroom—and rummages through a
						drawer, returning with a blue
						Sharpie.</p>
					<p>She draws a three-sided square,
						then two smaller ones nested
						inside, and explains: “It’s
						tiered stone,
						and I’d been playing over in my
						head how vast the stage is in
						Vegas. I was like, How do I make
						a
						stadium-size stage feel small in
						that room? I noticed all the
						borders around the fire, and I
						was like,
						What if I treat it like a puppet
						stage?” The next day, when the
						Stufish team came over to
						discuss
						design plans, she pointed to the
						mantelpiece: “I want that,” she
						told them.</p>
					<p>The new stage is an adaptation
						of her design, a fitting
						inspiration for a show that aims
						to capture
						the intimacy she was missing in
						that January dress rehearsal.
						With the show, Adele says, “I
						want to
						tell the story of the beginning
						of my career to now. I’m not
						gonna give too much about it,
						but the
						show grows. The show grows. It’s
						all about the music, and it’s
						really, really nostalgic. It’s
						gonna be
						really beautiful.”</p>

					<p>It will also, of course, feature
						plenty of her hallmark banter.
						“I haven’t got any bullet
						points,
						obviously, when I talk,” she
						says. “That’s why my shows are
						so erratic. One time I gave,
						like, an hour
						speech about an aquarium!” (For
						her combination of talent and
						showmanship, Dickins compares
						her to
						Barbra Streisand and Midler, the
						latter of whom referred to Adele
						as “a living doll” with
						“exquisite
						taste”: “She’s so warm and
						winning that it’s impossible not
						to fall under her spell.”)</p>
					<p>Adele wants to make things right
						for her fans, and anticipates
						feeling tremendous relief when
						the
						Vegas news is out. The residency
						makes logistical sense for her
						life—it’s critical to her that
						she not
						disturb her hard-earned
						co-parenting routine with
						Konecki, or uproot Angelo from
						his life in L.A.—and
						she also feels it’s the
						appropriate time in her career.
						“I think I’m right to do it
						right now,” she
						says. “I know I’m not, like, 60
						years old and I haven’t got 20
						albums under my belt. But I
						think my
						music will work in a show in
						Vegas.” She’s also excited to
						finally share in the communal
						enjoyment of
						her new music. “I haven’t really
						witnessed [30] out in the world
						yet,” Adele says. “It’s gonna be
						so
						emotional. I don’t know what I’m
						gonna do with meself.”</p>
					<p><img src="img/letter_i.jpg" width="27" height="43" alt="Letter "><span>t’s well

							relationship and felt
							despairingly lonely;

					<p>“I’ve never been in love like
						this. I’m obsessed with him.”
					</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>Gradually, she dug herself out
						of the hole. She committed
						herself to therapy and tried
						particularly
						L.A. balms, like sound baths and
						meditation. She started lifting
						weights and boxing every day,
						and
						found that the routine centered
						her, and that she liked feeling
						strong in her body. She also
						made
						amends with her estranged
						father, Mark Evans, who was
						absent for most of her life. He
						died of cancer
						in May 2021; Adele has said
						their reconciliation “set little
						me free.” </p>
					<p>Finally, and perhaps most
						pivotally, she fell madly in
						love. “Beyond,” she says. “I’ve
						never been in
						love like this. I’m obsessed
						with him.” Adele and Paul had
						been friends for some time, but
						their
						relationship became romantic in
						2021, and they went public when
						she sat courtside with him at an
						NBA
						Finals game that July. (“Lucky
						for him, I love basketball,”
						Adele says. She’s partial to the
						Phoenix
						Suns.) She turned 34 on May 5,
						and celebrated her one-year
						anniversary with Paul—as well as
						her
						purchase of a nearby Beverly
						Hills mansion formerly owned by
						Sylvester Stallone—nearly a week
						later.
					</p>
					<p>Paul has three children of his
						own, including a daughter in
						college, and they are renovating
						their new
						home together with a blended
						family in mind. (Adele’s one
						existing personal social media
						account is
						for Pinterest, where she says
						she’s been collecting ideas for
						interiors.) Paul seems a good
						match for
						Adele. He has repped LeBron
						James for a decade, giving him a
						familiarity with the
						stratospheric circle
						of fame she inhabits. She says
						he makes her feel safe, and
						encourages her to live her
						guarded life
						more freely. When they were
						discussing taking a vacation
						recently, Adele told Paul she
						had always
						wanted to go to one of the
						Italian islands, but feared the
						paparazzi presence there. “He
						was like,
						‘You would let that stop you
						from going to the place that you
						most want to go on vacation?’ ”
						she
						remembers, laughing with
						affection. “He’s like, ‘For one
						photograph, what’s the worst
						that can
						happen?’”</p>

					<p>When I ask if she wants to get

					<p>If you have big aspirations for
						2023—a big deadlift, a marathon,
						a change in the size of your
						body—I
						sure hope you haven’t translated
						them into the limited, pass-fail
						box-checking of a SMART goal.
						But I
						do hope that you’ve made
						yourself some SMART goals to
						guide you through the process.
						Let me explain.
					</p>
					<h3>Why SMART goals are different
						from Dream Goals</h3>
					<p>SMART goals have long been
						heralded as a goal-setting life
						hack, but the truth is that they
						were
						<a href="https://lifehacker.com/smart-goals-are-overrated-1847102198" target="_blank">invented for
							mangers to set quotas and
							such for their companies</a>
						(the original “A” stood
						for
						“assignable,” as in, to an
						employee).
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p> You can view more articles in
						the <mark><a href="#rl-str">Related
								Stories</a></mark> section
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>A SMART goal, as it’s talked
						about it the fitness world
						today, is Specific, Measurable,
						Attainable,
						Relevant, and Time-bound. Put
						together, this means you set a
						deadline by which time you
						expect to
						achieve a specific measurement
						of an outcome. In other words,
						you’ve turned it into a
						pass-fail test.
					</p>
					<p>And because you wouldn’t want to
						fail that pass-fail test,
						creating a proper SMART goal
						means that you
						need to set the bar low. The
						goal has to be Attainable,
						remember? When you look at it
						that way, SMART
						goals are not goals in the way I
						would think of the word, in the
						sense of big dreams that inspire
						us
						to keep going. But we can use
						them as benchmarks to be hit on
						the way to what I’ll call our
						Dream
						Goals.</p>
					<h3>How to dream big while still
						setting process goals</h3>
					<p>I’ve written before that <a href="https://lifehacker.com/smart-goals-are-overrated-1847102198" target="_blank">SMART goals
							are overrated</a>, but to be
						honest, they make a good
						framework for
						process goals. Process goals are
						things that are fully in our
						control. They are Attainable, by
						definition. For example, going
						for a run three times a week is
						a process goal. Eating a
						vegetable at
						every meal is a process goal.
						Following a program that tells
						you to do five sets of eight
						reps of
						deadlifts every Tuesday is a
						process goal. </p>
					<p>And the point of a process goal
						is to put you on the path to
						your big Dream Goal. I like to
						think of
						it this way: Your Dream Goal is
						a big mountain off in the
						distance. You know it’s there,
						but you don’t
						know exactly how far away it is,
						or how tough the journey will
						be. Your process goals are
						things that
						will keep you on the path toward
						that mountain. Packing your
						bags. Putting one foot in front
						of the
						other. Or as Peloton instructor
						Tunde Oyeneyin puts it (right
						before telling me I better beat
						my score
						from her last burpee circuit):
						“A goal is a wish. A standard
						holds us accountable.” We need
						both.</p>
					<p>I can’t emphasize how important
						it is that we allow ourselves to
						dream big. “Take 1 minute off my
						5K
						race time this year” is
						attainable, but why limit
						yourself to that? “Run a 5K in
						under 20 minutes” is
						a big-as-hell dream (especially
						if you’re around 30 minutes
						right now) but it’s very much
						worth
						working for. The path up that
						mountain might be a long one,
						but it’s not going to walk
						itself.</p>
					<h3>How your SMART goals can
						support your Dream Goals</h3>
					<p>So, let’s start charting that
						path. As with any trip up a
						faraway mountain, you won’t know
						quite what
						the road is like until you get
						there. So focus on what’s right
						in front of you and what you can
						control.</p>
					<p>Here’s an example of how you can
						set some SMART process goals to
						guide you toward a big dream
						that may
						or may not be achievable. Let’s
						say you’re a runner, and you
						want to be a faster runner. You
						might
						chart out a journey like this:
					</p>
					<p>Dream goal: Run a 20-minute or
						faster 5K (someday)</p>
					<p>Process goals: </p>
					<ol>
						<li>Build up my aerobic base by
							running a few more miles each
							week, until I am running 20
							miles a
							week.</li>
						<li>Run a time trial at the
							track, both as a benchmark
							and so I can calculate my
							training paces.</li>
						<li>Follow the <a href="https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/5k-training/intermediate-5k/" target="_blank">Hal Higdon
								Intermediate 5K Training
								Program</a> as written.
						</li>
						<li>Run the Big Local 5K in my
							city this spring.</li>
						<li>Write down my time, assess
							my strengths and weaknesses,
							and decide on a new set of
							process goals
							for summer training.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>See how each of these is a SMART
						goal? </p>
					<ul>
						<li>They are all specific enough
							that you know each day what
							to do. (I’ve given a mileage
							number and
							picked out a specific
							training program, but
							obviously you would choose
							your own.) </li>
						<li>They are measurable: You hit
							the miles, you check off the
							number of workouts
							programmed.</li>
						<li>They are attainable: You
							have full control of whether
							or not you go out for a run.
							(Obviously, if
							you don’t have full control
							over this due to life
							circumstances, you would
							write a different set of
							goals that take those
							circumstances into account.)
						</li>
						<li>They are relevant: They all
							set you on the path toward
							being a faster runner at the
							5K distance.
						</li>
						<li>They are time-bound: From
							this framework, you could sit
							down and schedule every
							single run on your
							calendar for the next three
							or four months. (You would
							work backward from the race
							date to find the
							start of the training
							program, and so on.)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These goals define your process,
						and then you get to reassess.
						After the Big Local 5K, do you
						want to
						do more specific 5K training to
						get faster? Do you want to train
						for a marathon for the
						base-building
						opportunities and because you
						kind of like the idea of a side
						quest? Or might you find that
						your other
						goals in life conflict with this
						one—perhaps you’d rather take
						the summer off to do more
						paddleboarding, and return to
						run training in the fall? </p>
					<p>This way, you still get to dream
						big, but you know you’re always
						on the path to those big
						goals—at
						least as long as you want to be.
						Shoot for the moon, and if you
						don’t make it, at least you’ve
						built a
						good damn rocket ship along the
						way.</p>

							and mice for 36 years.</p>

							more than 500
							pieces of animal armor since
							he crafted his first mouse

					</div>

					<div>
						<p>For de Boer, the purpose is
							not for four-legged creatures
							to actually wear his
							elaborate hand-made
							armaments, but rather to jolt
							people’s imagination and call
							forth the hero in underdogs.
						</p>
						<p>“Each person brings their own
							story to my work,” de Boer
							explains. “I'm not the author
							of a story;
							I'm the maker of artifacts
							for a yet unrealized story."
						</p>
						<h3>“It all started with a
							mouse”</h3>
						<p>De Boer’s inspiration began
							with a visit to the armor
							collection at Calgary’s <a href="https://www.glenbow.org/" target="_blank">Glenbow
								Museum</a> when he was
							five years old.
							“I think that at a very early
							age children recognize armor
							as something interesting, and
							for me it
							was really haunting,” the
							59-year-old artist recalls.
							“How was this made? Who wore
							it? Why did they
							wear it? What were the
							experiences that that armor
							had? Those thoughts and ideas
							have been with me
							my entire life."</p>
						<p>De Boer started tooling
							around in his father’s metal
							fabrication shop and made his
							first human-size
							suit of armor in high school.
							But as a jewelry major in art
							school in the mid-1980s, he
							had to
							somehow reconcile the small
							scale of the items he was
							creating with his passion for
							armor. He could
							craft armor for people at a
							miniature size, but that felt
							inauthentic. What sort of
							relatively tiny
							armor could he create that
							still felt like it had a real
							purpose?</p>
						<p>“And then it dawned on me: I
							could make a suit of armor
							for a mouse,” he recalls.
							“That was the
							transitional moment—as Disney
							said, "It all started with a
							mouse."</p>
					</div>

						<p>Left: De Boer's latest

							Winged Hussars.

					<div>
						<p>As his vision came into
							focus, de Boer realized he
							needed to introduce an
							antagonist into his world
							of armored mice. Naturally,
							it was cats.</p>
						<p>De Boer also sees an analogy
							in the art world. To him,
							cats can represent the power
							of the world of
							fine art, where works can
							command millions of dollars,
							while mice represent the
							artisans who
							struggle to find patrons to
							fund their work and keep
							their craft alive.</p>
						<h3>Making history, not just
							“things”</h3>
						<p>The Armor for Cats and Mice
							series is just one of a
							number of works by de Boer—he
							also creates
							<a href="https://www.armet.ca/" target="_blank">jewelry</a>,
							<a href="https://www.gallerieswest.ca/magazine/columns/airports-as-art-galleries---yyc-and-anc/" target="_blank">large
								public sculptures</a>, and
							even
							funeral urns—but the
							animal armor remains closest
							to his
							heart with its particular
							focus on history and
							archaeology.
						</p>
						<p>Once de Boer determines the
							culture and timeframe for an
							armor project, he conducts
							extensive
							research on armament styles
							of the time, then draws the
							concept by hand. He then
							crafts clay models
							from the drawings, which help
							him draft exact patterns for
							each of some 30-200 separate
							metal
							elements that the armor may
							require. (A Roman gladiator
							mouse, for example, may be
							made of 50
							different parts, while scaled
							cat armor may have 500.)</p>
						<p>Since the artist works on a
							miniature scale, he creates
							his own tiny tools and rivets
							to fashion
							the armor elements. It can
							take 40 hours just to make
							the roughly 5 to 10 custom
							tools needed to
							create a particular style of
							mouse armor, then an
							additional 30-50 hours to
							create each mouse. Most
							are crafted from nickel,
							steel, and/or brass (and
							sometimes gold or platinum),
							and finished with
							flourishes like whiskers or
							tassels.</p>
						<p>De Boer isn’t concerned that
							3D printing will make his
							work obsolete; rather, he’s
							cheered by the
							number of artisans and
							collectors who follow his
							work on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jeffdeboersculpture/" target="_blank">social
								media</a> and are
							inspired to keep the
							metallurgy craft alive for
							future generations.</p>
						<p>“We’re all part of making
							history,” he says. “We're not
							just making things. We are
							part of
							something past, present, and
							future.”</p>

						<h3>Inspiration everywhere</h3>
						<p>Who exactly needs a suit of
							cat or mouse armor? De Boer
							says the collectors and other
							patrons who
							commission his work have a
							variety of backgrounds, but
							all share a deep interest in
							history and
							art. “Probably the one thing
							everybody has in common is
							they probably all subscribe
							to National
							Geographic,” he jokes.</p>
						<p>The requests are always
							individual and very personal.
							In the case of cat armor, the
							request is
							often to memorialize a
							beloved pet who has passed
							away. De Boer incorporates
							the individual stories
							of the animals into this
							work, making the armor a sort
							of portrait or even reliquary
							of each one.
							He also occasionally creates
							armor for other species, like
							the samurai dog helmet
							commissioned by a
							police officer to capture the
							“warrior spirit” of his
							retired four-legged partner.
						</p>
						<p>The patrons for his mouse
							armor find inspiration
							everywhere and sometimes ask
							for types of armor
							that have never been seen on
							human battlefields. De Boer
							is currently working on a
							commission from
							an Indian-Polish couple that
							combines elements of
							17th-century armor from both
							the Indian <a href="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Maratha_Empire" target="_blank">
								Maratha
								Empire</a> and the <a href="https://culture.pl/en/article/polands-winged-knights-from-invincible-glory-to-obsolescence" target="_blank">Polish
								Hussars</a>. “Something I
							would never think to do,”
							he concedes, “but it's
							exciting because you have
							these two cultures, and you
							are doing the research and
							you discover
							they're both contemporary.”

						<p>De Boer stresses that his
							work is not intended to be
							worn by living animals,
							describing the first
							and last time he was asked to
							dress a cat in armor. It was
							for a Japanese game show in
							the early
							1990s, and a television crew
							showed up at his studio with
							a “stunt cat” that was
							allegedly very
							comfortable wearing clothes
							on camera. “Let's just say
							that we had a very large cat
							in a very small
							suit of armor,” he says.
							“Highly not recommended.”</p>
						<h3>Artisans and artifacts
							across the ages</h3>
						<p>When discussing his work, de
							Boer often brings up the
							experience he had coming
							face-to-face with
							<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photo-of-the-day/photo/king-tut-funerary-mask" target="_blank">Tutankhamun’s
								golden mask</a> in the
							Cairo Museum. “The thing that
							came to my
							mind wasn't the amazing
							object in front of me—which
							clearly it is. But my
							thoughts went to the day it
							was finished.
							Imagining the Egyptian
							artisans sitting in their
							workshop, having their
							friends over for a beer,
							celebrating this beautiful
							accomplishment and saying the
							same things that I would say:
							'I'm
							grateful I had a patron,' and
							'Isn't it amazing that 10
							generations of skills have
							been developed
							so that we can produce
							something like this?'"
						</p>
						<p>And just as
							archaeologists—and the
							world—marveled at Tut’s
							golden mask <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/topic/king-tuts-treasures-100-years-later" target="_blank"> when it
								was discovered in
								1922</a>, de Boer wonders
							how people will react to
							his cat- and mouse armor
							centuries from now, whether
							it’s in a museum or
							discovered in the excavation
							of a 21st-century residence.
						</p>
						<p>“Would they have the same
							reaction, ask the same
							questions?” he muses. “Why
							was it made? Is this
							real? Who made it, and why,
							and for whom?”</p>
						<p>“Those are the same questions
							that have inspired me to
							become an artist," he adds.
							"In a sense,
							it's becoming part of a
							continuum of history through
							the work that the artisans of
							the past left
							behind—the artifacts that I
							discovered inspired me to do
							this. And I hope that my work
							will do the
							same for future generations.”
